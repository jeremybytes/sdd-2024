# DI Why? Getting a Grip on Dependency Injection  

*Coding Level: 4*  
*Advanced Level: 2*  

Many of our modern frameworks have Dependency Injection (DI) built in. But how do you use that effectively? We need to look at what DI is and why we want to use it. We’ll look at the problems caused by tight coupling. Then we’ll use some DI patterns such as constructor injection and property injection to break that tight coupling. We’ll see how loosely-coupled applications are easier to extend and test. With a better understanding of the basic patterns, we’ll remove the magic behind DI containers so that we can use the tools appropriately in our code. Attendees will need some familiarity with C# (at least six months or so), but no experience with dependency injection is necessary.
