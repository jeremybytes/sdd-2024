# Take Your C# Skills to the Next Level   
**Full-day Workshop**  
*Coding Level: 4*  
*Advanced Level: 2*  

Are you a C# developer eager to create software that is easy to maintain, has minimal bugs, and makes your users happy? If so, this workshop is for you.  

Through lectures, code samples, and hands-on labs, you will learn how interfaces, delegates, dependency injection, and unit testing can help you write applications that are easy to extend, change, and debug. Along the way you will also encounter modern C# topics such as nullability, switch expressions, and asynchronous code. In the end, you will take away practical experience that you can immediately apply to your own projects. Topics will include:  

* **Interfaces**: Explore the art of writing clean, modular code through interfaces. Learn how interfaces facilitate code extension, make your applications more testable, and lead to fewer bugs.  
* **Delegates**: Gain a deep understanding of delegates and learn how to use them to build flexible and extensible code.  
* **Dependency Injection**: Discover the magic of dependency injection and how it promotes loose coupling, making your codebase more flexible, testable, and maintainable.  
* **Unit Testing**: Write tests that ensure your code functions as expected, enabling you to catch bugs early in the development process.  

Key Benefits:  

* **Easier Maintenance**: Explore practices for writing clean, maintainable code that’s a breeze to work with, whether you’re collaborating with a team or revisiting your own projects down the road.  
* **Fewer Bugs**: Learn the art of writing robust code that is easy to test. Find bugs before your users do, and be confident that code changes do not break existing functionality.  
* **Happier Users**: The point of writing software is to meet your user’s needs. With these tools in hand, you can create applications that not only meet but exceed user expectations.  

Pre-Requisites:  

Basic understanding of C# and object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, methods, and properties). No prior experience with the primary topics is necessary; we’ll take care of that as we go.  

Take your C# development skills to the next level and build software that not only satisfies your users, but also simplifies your life as a developer. Say goodbye to frustrating bugs, hello to happier users, and welcome to the world of painless maintenance.
