# Take Your C# Skills to the Next Level   
**Full-day Workshop**  
*Coding Level: 4*  
*Advanced Level: 2*  

## Description
Are you a C# developer eager to create software that is easy to maintain, has minimal bugs, and makes your users happy? If so, this workshop is for you.  

Through lectures, code samples, and hands-on labs, you will learn how interfaces, delegates, dependency injection, and unit testing can help you write applications that are easy to extend, change, and debug. Along the way you will also encounter modern C# topics such as nullability, switch expressions, and asynchronous code. In the end, you will take away practical experience that you can immediately apply to your own projects. Topics will include:  

* **Interfaces**: Explore the art of writing clean, modular code through interfaces. Learn how interfaces facilitate code extension, make your applications more testable, and lead to fewer bugs.  
* **Delegates**: Gain a deep understanding of delegates and learn how to use them to build flexible and extensible code.  
* **Dependency Injection**: Discover the magic of dependency injection and how it promotes loose coupling, making your codebase more flexible, testable, and maintainable.  
* **Unit Testing**: Write tests that ensure your code functions as expected, enabling you to catch bugs early in the development process.  

Key Benefits:  

* **Easier Maintenance**: Explore practices for writing clean, maintainable code that’s a breeze to work with, whether you’re collaborating with a team or revisiting your own projects down the road.  
* **Fewer Bugs**: Learn the art of writing robust code that is easy to test. Find bugs before your users do, and be confident that code changes do not break existing functionality.  
* **Happier Users**: The point of writing software is to meet your user’s needs. With these tools in hand, you can create applications that not only meet but exceed user expectations.  

Pre-Requisites:  

Basic understanding of C# and object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, methods, and properties). No prior experience with the primary topics is necessary; we’ll take care of that as we go.  

## Hands-on Lab Requirements:

> Note: Due to the layout of the rooms, we will not have dedicated time for lab work. Feel free to bring your laptop to follow along with slides and code samples. The Lab files are available for you to reinforce the learning once you get back home.

* Interactive labs can be completed using Windows, macOS, and Linux (anywhere .NET 6/8 will run).

* You need to have the .NET 6 SDK or .NET 8 SDK installed as well as the code editor of your choice (Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition or Visual Studio Code are both good (free) choices).

### Links:

* .NET 8.0 SDK
[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

* Visual Studio 2022 (Community)
[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
Note: Install the "ASP.NET and web development" workload for the labs and samples. Include ".NET desktop development" for "digit-display" sample and WPF-based samples.

* Visual Studio Code

## Hands-on Labs

The "Labs" folder contains the hands-on labs. As noted above, this workshop will not have dedicated lab time, but each lab has a step-by-step walkthrough if you want to try things out yourself.  

* [Lab 00 - Application Overview](Labs/Lab00/)  
* [Lab 01 - Adding Interfaces for Better Control](Labs/Lab01/)  
* [Lab 02 - Adding Unit Tests](Labs/Lab02/)  
* [Lab 03 - More Dependency Injection](Labs/Lab03/)  

Each lab consists of the following:  
* **Labxx-Instructions** (Markdown)  
A markdown file containing the lab instructions. This includes a set of goals and step-by-step instructions. This can be viewed on GitHub or in Visual Studio Code (just click the "Open Preview to the Side" button in the upper right corner).  

* **dotnet6 / dotnet8** (Folders)  
Lab code is available for both .NET 6.0 and .NET 8.0 (the current .NET releases).

    * **Starter** (Folder)  
    This folder contains the starting code for the lab.  
    * **Completed** (Folder)  
    This folder contains the completed solution. If at any time you get stuck during the lab, you can check this folder for a solution.  

In addition, each lab builds on the previous. So the "Completed" of Lab 01 is the "Starter" of Lab 02. If you go through the labs in order, you can keep using the same solution as you move from lab to lab.
